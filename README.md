In this week's challenge I went through two separtae challenges and wrote scripts for it. I used VScode for this project.

PyBank:
In this challenge I had to create a code to analyize the data and find the total months included in the data, the total Profit/Losses over the entire period, the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the entire period.
The code for this ran and the data was shown in the analysis page.


PyPoll:
In this challenge I had to go over the election results for an area and analyize the data through my script. I had to write a scrip to find the total votes casted, the winner of the election. the total votes of the winners, and the percentage.
The code for this looks fine to me but I couldn't run it, I am not sure why it is still saying the file is not valid or found something, I did a lot of research and applied everything I found but it didn't work. I am assuming I am doing something wrong. 



Help:
I got help from the class notes. I also searched YouTube and Google. Finally, my tutor helped me with some of the codes.
